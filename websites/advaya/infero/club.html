<b>"Most people spend more time and energy going around problems than in trying to solve them."
<br/>-Henry Ford</b>
<br/><br/>Thus said, it is not very hard to bump into a problem anytime any day, as if the problems already here were any less. But at IIT H, we are a bunch of fellows who take care of everyone's problems in our own nice geeky way, we think logically, we talk reasonably but well, we are too clumsy and lazy to act, our programs do it instead. Yes, we are Infero, the Programming & Logical reasoning club of IIT H. We are a lively example of how computer-science can revolutionize the art of problem solving for one and all. And to anyone who wants to contribute to the general cause, our group is forever open
