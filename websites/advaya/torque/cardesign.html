<font size="+3">Car Design Competition:</font><br/><br/>

<div align="left">
<font size="+1">
TORQUE, The Automobile club of IIT Hyderabad is organizing a design competition as part of its activities. The objective is to think of enhancements to automobiles that can make life easier for drivers all over the world.
<br/><br/>When windshield wipers were invented, they did not have the option of intermittent wiping. They kept running continuously and when the rain was light, they would squeak. Robert Kearns came up with the idea for the intermittent wind shield wiper to solve this problem.
<br/><br/>There are loads of problems (big or small) that still need fixing that people are just used to and don’t even notice any longer. This competition is targeted at bringing out these problems and solving them.</font>

<font size="+1">
The competition would be conducted in two phases, each spanning approximately a month.
<br/>The first phase is an open challenge to all students of IITH to come up with problems faced by drivers and solutions to them, or just useful and cost effective enhancements to automobiles.
<br/>In the second phase, the best (on the basis of problem, not solution) out of the entries received along with possibly a few of our own will be put up for people to solve.
<br/><br/>The event will be judged by one of our professors, and his decision is final.
<br/>The solutions have to be original or have a sufficient degree of originality to qualify and while judging, emphasis will be on the cost effectiveness of the solution.
<br/><br/>Examples (Just to give you an idea):
<ul>

</ul>
<br/>Of course, these already exist. We’re looking for similar stuff that doesn’t. We don’t want to give you too many examples and create any impressions. Just let your imagination run wild, then make sure your idea is feasible and really useful/helpful before you send it in. And if ever you’re unable to decide if an idea is original enough, just let us worry about that. Deadline for the first round is 18th September (Sunday) 11.59 pm.
