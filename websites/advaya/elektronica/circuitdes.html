  <font size="+1">  It is nothing but the first step to make your hands dirty in indulging in this event. We require you to write a page/ two (max! we are pretty lazy, as u know :P) as an abstract about what you intend to do. Mesmerize us with your abstracts and find yourself selected for the event.
  <br/> Abstract should contain a brief description, circuit design, components & estimated cost.

  <font size="+1">  Actually we have very few rules. The main rule is everything is finalized by the organizers.
