<font size="+3">Robo Basket Ball:</font><br/><br/>

<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">
    Can you design a bot that works any way you want it to?
  <br/><br/>Can you make it throw a ball accurately?
  <br/><br/>Gather your buddies, bring out your innovation and shoot hoops …………..</font><br/><br/>
  <font size="+2">Problem Statement</font><br/>
    
  <font size="+1">Make a bot that can project a ball. the projectile should rise a minimum of 5cm from its point of projection.
  <br/>
    The throw will be manually controlled. the energy given to the ball during projection shall be free of muscular power. Thus the participant is only allowed to trigger the mechanism that will subsequently project the ball.
  <br/>
    Each bot should be able to vary the range and height of the projectile as per requirement.
  <br/>
    The bot must carry its ball with it before entering the shooting area.
  </font><br/><br/>
  <font size="+2">Specs</font><br/>
  <font size="+1">
    1) standard table tennis ball shall be used in all rounds.<br/>
    2) the bot must not exceed dimensions of 25*25*35(all in cms). size violation will earn penalty.<br/>
    3) the bot controls can be wireless or wired. In wired bots the wires shall always be loose.<br/>
    4) all teams can comprise of maximum of 3 members. there is no restriction on composition of members.<br/>

  <font size="+2">Event Format</font><br/>
  <font size="+1">
    The event will be in 2 main rounds.
  </font><br/>
  <font size="+2">Range round:</font><br/>
  <font size="+1">The first round will test range accuracy of the bots. the arena will be as shown in the image.<br/>
    The bot has to aim from 170cms from centre of concentric circles.<br/>
    The point where ball lands first time will be taken for evaluation. Subsequent motion is neglected.<br/>
    Inner most circle carries 400pts. Other circles carry 100 points less than the biggest circle inside them.<br/>
    All bots earn a negative point of 20*time(in seconds).<br/>
    All bots will go through this round twice.

  <font size="+2">Experts round:</font><br/>
  <font size="+1">
    3 hoops will be hanged at different heights from ground. each hoop will have 2 shooting zones marked. The max height for hoops will be 1-metre.<br/>
    For points scheme refer to image.<br/>
    All bots will go through this round twice. Teams are allowed to choose same or different shooting zones in these attempts.<br/>
    See image for details of pts for each shooting zone.<br/>
    Incase the ball touches the hoop but fails to pass through then the team gets half points for that attempt.

    A surprise 3rd round may be conducted as a tie-breaker.
  <br/>
    1) The penalty on size violation will be 20(&Delta;l+&Delta;b+&Delta;h)(all in cms).
  <br/>
  2) All teams must submit their designs and abstract comprising of cost-estimate and components required, by mail or in paper to either of the organisers before 30th of September.
  <br/>
  3) Depending on the abstracts some teams may be selected and provided required components by the advaya team.
  <br/>
  4) All decision taken by organisers will be final and all competitors are bound to accept them.  </font>  </p>
