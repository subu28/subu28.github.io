In this talk, we describe enormous opportunities for innovation in delivering information technology based services. We start by describing the tremendous inefficiencies, estimated to be about $15 Trillion, in how the world operates today (e.g. in industries like transportation and healthcare), some of which can be eliminated by infusing more instrumentation and intelligence into these systems. We then describe some unique challenges faced in emerging economies like India, and present an example of developing a solution built from the ground up with those unique requirements in mind. The specific example we present is Spoken Web, our attempt to create a new world wide web, accessible over the (mobile) phone network, for the masses in countries like India. Finally, we describe several opportunities for improving efficiency, quality and value from delivering various kinds of services globally (an area of unique strength for India), and the interesting computer science and multidisciplinary problems that arise in the context of pursuing those opportunities.

The talk starts off with a briefing of some general principles about leadership qualities and what makes a good leader. Though leadership involves decisions and actions relating to all sorts of other things, it is very special because leadership is centrally concerned with people. hence, the path of a growing leader is full of obstacles and is troublesome. The lecture concentrates on the various troubles a person faces on his journey to become a leader ( eg : team attitude problem , communication problems ). Then the focus of the talk shifts to the most important and the most interesting part i.e. the different means by which one can overcome these obstacles. Thus the lecture concludes by providing a complete outlook to transform one's self into a successful leader in any field.";
