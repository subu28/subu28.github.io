                    <h2>ONE LAST TIME</h2>
<p><i>Pratyush Peddireddi (4th year undergraduate)</i></p>

<p>I was watching TV recently. Happy Days was on. So I watched a bit of it. When I watched this movie in the theater four years ago, I'd found it so beautiful and exciting. It came about 8 months before my JEE and it motivated me to put in that extra effort for those few remaining months 'cause the Promsied Land and my own Tamanna awaited on the other side. But now, a few weeks into the fourth year, as I watched Tyson, his adorable little sister and Shravs discussing life and love, I couldn't stand the bloody movie with its immense &lt;3ness. Every scene was really REALLY irritating. I was totally taken aback at the complete contrast in the way I was reacting to the movie. As I sit in my chair writing this, I don't have a Tamanna by my side. In fact, I'm checking out Shabana Chauhan. She is my friend's friend's FB friend. More importantly, she's a really hot Punjabi chick. Fortunately, her photos' privacy settings are pretty liberal, so I can see all of her photos. For me, that's a waterfall bonanza. Now this is where you go, "What a pathetic existence!!!". Not quite Happy Days is it? I guess that's why the movie pisses me off so much in my present state.</p>

<p>Ok forget girls for a while, adi ayye pani kaadu. I have seven proper months left in college. And I have to make them count. I don't have anything particular in mind, just a voice in my head telling me that, to quote heartthrob Siddharth's recent movie's tagline, "ee vayasika raadu".(translation for the Amits, these days are not coming back). After we're done here, people will head in different directions. Before we're gone, our batch should look to leave a legacy. So that when we're gone, there will be something we're remembered for/by. If not now, even after going out, I'll strive to make some notable contribution so that the days of -<br/><i>X to me: "Which college?", Me: "IIT Hyderabad", X: "You mean IIIT in Gachibowli?"</i>, are over. </p>

<p>All I wanna do now is enjoy the remaining days. Chilling in canteen, (the aspiring pedophiles that we are), do waterfalls on the new 1st year babe who is currently the no.1 trending girl in our hostel, inspite of the huge age difference. We absolutely must have a massive party in LH 3, it is such a perfect party venue. That whole new roof itself is such a mast place to chill at. Lots of new faces, college is really happening right now, we've come a long way since August 2008. Now we just need a nice little finish.</p>
