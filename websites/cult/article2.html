                    <h2>How difficult it is to write</h2>
<p><i>Shyama Purnima (4th year undergraduate)</i></p>

<p>[Un]Fortunately, one of my friends had to write an article for one of our magazines. How does that matter to me? Come on, I am not of that kind who would worry about others&rsquo; jobs. Else what? Well, fortune kicked me out and took him in when he got a call from the IIMs and had to leave. And the rest is mere trivia that I do not want to explain here as people already think I am verbose. :\ I D C D anyway.</p>

<p>Initially hyper-excited, thanks to a few written flukes in a course, I promised him that I will write an article in place of him in a day or two. Boo! Then started my journey to the No Man&rsquo;s Land. (Don&rsquo;t go trolling about the man-woman concept now, I am already vexed enough.) So, I started &lsquo;brain storming&rsquo; about the topics to write. Before I tell you what all ideas &lsquo;possessed&rsquo; me, its my duty to warn you that I have some very weird qualities and Its OK to have them &mdash; and I am perfectly sane for all those who think it is gonna be lame, see I started to rhyme, and plz I don&rsquo;t need a dime(have patience brats!). </p>

<p>First and the foremost, I have a very uncanny habit of giving anything and everything I see, a twisted philosophical touch and feel extremely bewildered about the realization. Add to it, all the psychology I learnt in two courses. My thoughts found a new vent and boom! It started with a friend talking about how bad and sad her life is. After giving her an enlightening lecture till she threw me out of the room, I decided to write on &ldquo;Life and how people percieve it&rdquo;. (heavy sigh- :\) I started with &ldquo;Oh God! Why did you give me this life?&rdquo; and surprisingly ended it there as I couldn&rsquo;t think of which of the myriad number of instances I should quote. Damn.</p>

<p>The next thing that makes my hair go hay-way is when I hear about prodigies who achieved so much in life at a very early stage. I sense a mixture of envy, jealousy and all such &ndash;nessnessness feelings in myself at that point. And those are what led to me to write on &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t I have done it?&rdquo; And with a strong push of adrenaline, I started &mdash; &ldquo;I donno about you but whenever I have an encounter with facts like these, I am no more what I was the second before- one would find me go silent and numb for a few seconds&ndash; in a state of deep self analysis that WHY I am not like them. After a lot of &ndash; &rdquo;?????  After a lot of what?! @#!@!#! EnougH! Period.</p>

<p>Installing a last ray of hope in my otherwise &lsquo;blue-dead&rsquo; system, the feminist inside me spoke and said &ndash; &lsquo;Being a girl&rsquo;. And then I waited on and on and on. It did not speak again.<img style="margin:0px; padding:0px; height:16px; border:none;" src="images/smiley/poker.png"></p>

<p>Then I tried putting a stop to my grey cells which were apparently turning gray <img style="margin:0px; padding:0px; height:16px; border:none;" src="images/smiley/sad.png"> But still, they didn&rsquo;t listen to me. Things ranging from &ndash; &lsquo;A Jekyll and Hyde Realization&rsquo;, which was supposedly supposed to be on the different angles in a person inspired from a course, &lsquo;The Hype tributes to Celebs&rsquo; on why the celebrities are hyped so much when they in reality are simply doing their work like anyone to abstract stuff like &lsquo;etymology of words&rsquo;, which I guess GRE prep gave me and then to &lsquo;solace in solitude&rsquo;, on how and what different people do to win over solitude, and to even worser ones where I ran the whole wide circle and ran back to pavilion into philosophy.</p>

<p>After all this <i>drama</i>, a brilliant idea finally came to me- and that was.. to search on the internet! (:\ yea, it seemed brilliant then) And so I went &lsquo;onto&rsquo; the internet and searched, never did I even dream I would do it, but I did about &lsquo;Topics to write&rsquo; and Ka-boom! A flood of them out there like &lsquo;How I use Facebook&rsquo;(yeah right!), &lsquo;Ten Guiltiest Pleasures&rsquo;(pardon me! WhAt!), &lsquo;Who knows me best?&rsquo;, &lsquo;An unforgettable dream&rsquo;and then URGH!!!</p>

<p>Then at that point I felt it. I infact knew it from long. The ugly blatant truth. It is very difficult to write. A final Period.</p>
