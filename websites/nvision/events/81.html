	It’s an application of persistence of vision (POV) where a series of Light bulbs(LEDs) moved in a plane to get a meaningful image (Eg. A wall clock in this case). This is the event to make such a clock. A typical arrangement of it consists of a rotating circuit board with LEds on it.
        <br/><br/><b>Problem Statement:</b><br/>Make a 2-D display, POV based Propeller clock. The clock should use an electric motor (suggested high RPM) to move the frame in circular fashion. The club will provide maximum 1 mcu and 1 motor with the other components (specified by the participants). A maximum of 12 volts supply will be provided to drive the propeller clock
        <br/><br/><b>Judging Criteria & Scoring:</b><br/>

            <li><b>Target 1</b>)   5 points will be given to display a clock (analog or digital type) that can measure seconds at least.</li>
            <li><b>Target 2</b>)   5 points will be given to display “ I I T H” or” I I T HYDERABAD”</li>
            <li><b>Target 3</b>)   this will be evaluated only after achievement of Target 1 or Target 2. The system performance is graded on a 1-10 scale. This includes robustness, stillness and clarity of image ,multicolor image and other cosmetics.</li>
