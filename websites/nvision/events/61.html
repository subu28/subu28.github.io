            <b>Problem Statement</b><br/>
            Design, build and test a vehicle using one or two snap mousetraps as the sole propulsion energy source.<br/><br/>
            <b>Round 1</b></p>
        <ul style="color:rgb(10,36,106);margin:0px; text-align:justify;">
            <li>The vehicle has to cover maximum possible distance in a time span of 10 seconds. It should be noted that the path can be little rough, so provision of adequate clearance should be made !</li>
            <li>The distance that would be taken into consideration will depend on the position of vehicle at the end of 10th second measured from the starting point.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <p style="color:rgb(10,36,106);margin:0px; text-align:justify;"> <b>Round 2</b></p>
        <ul style="color:rgb(10,36,106);margin:0px; text-align:justify;">
            <li>In this round the aim is to stop the mousetrap car closest to a specified target.</li>
            <li>The target is 5 meters from the start line, in the center of the 2 meter wide track.</li>
            <li>The winning car will be the one that stops closest to the specified target. Points would be awarded accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
        
	<p style="color:rgb(10,36,106);margin:0px; text-align:justify;"><b>Round 3</b></p>
        <ul style="color:rgb(10,36,106);margin:0px; text-align:justify;">
            <li>In this round the mousetrap car has to push a plastic cup (8-13cm) out a distance and return to a point behind the starting line as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>Reversing and stopping mechanisms must work automatically.</li>
            <li>The vehicle must push a standard disposable plastic cup (provided by the Event Supervisor) to the 3 meter Line, leave it there, reverse direction, and stop at the center of the Minus 4-meter Line in order to receive the ideal Distance Score.</li>
            <li>Decisions taken by event co-ordinators will be final.</li>
        </ul>

         What is a mousetrap powered car and how does it work?<br/><br/>
A mouse trap-powered racer is a vehicle that is powered by the energy of a wound-up mousetrap's spring. The most basic design is to tie one end of a string to the tip of a mousetrap's snapper arm and then the other end of the string has a loop that is designed to "catch" a hook that is glued to a drive axle<br/><br/>
How far can a mouse trap car travel?<br/><br/>
The sky is the limit! The first mouse trap car Doc Fizzix ever made only went 26 meters. Currently, Doc Fizzix has made a car travel over 182 meters.<br/><br/>
