	Here is our version of Junkyard Wars. Do not miss hogging the limelight as contestants scramble to make something out of nothing. Yeah you read it right- Something out of nothing. This is the land where, missile launchers are made of paper, choppers are made from ice cream sticks and balloons, lifting machines are made out of syringes and hydraulics. It has been traditionally getting massive participation as engineers here have been trained to build everything from anything.
