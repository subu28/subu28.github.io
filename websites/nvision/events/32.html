<br/>At this Beginner Level, we will be testing out the "LOGIC" in you.<br/>
<b><br/>Snippets of code will be given; you have to either decipher the output or sniff out the errors in the given output.</b><br/>
<br/>--> Only pen & paper. No laptops will be allowed !!<br/><br/>
<b>2. Intermediate Level</b><br/>
"Ready....Set....CODE !!"<br/>
At this Intermediate Level, our main aim is to test your ingenuity, patience and of course your programming skills.<br/>
<br/><b>The problem statement will comprise of 3-4 questions. Two will be teasers (short but tangy !!) and the others will be hard-core programs. Programming Language of your choice be it C, C++, Java, Python, etc.</b><br/>
<br/>--> Laptops are allowed. However internet cannot be used !!<br/><br/>
<b>3. Advanced Level</b><br/>
