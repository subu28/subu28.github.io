                    <li>Build a telescope which has all the essential components prices summed up to less than XXX.</li>
                    <li>Every team has to submit a draft or a plan regarding their telescope to the Cepheid club regarding the design of their telescope. Cepheid club accordingly will provide the components required for every team to build their telescope.</li>

                    <li>The time provided to build the telescope at the time of event will be maximum two hours.</li>
                    <li>The telescope will be judged mainly upon the following points-<br/>
